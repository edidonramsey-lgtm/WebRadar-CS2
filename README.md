Undetected Web Radar for Counter-Strike 2 is a modern software solution that discreetly collects data on the positions of all players on the map in real time, transmitting it to an external display or device without making any changes to the game files. 
The use of network data interception and memory reading methods through special technologies minimizes the likelihood of detection by Valve and Faceit protection systems. 
Such a tool provides the user with a tactical advantage, allowing them to see even opponents hidden behind objects, while remaining almost invisible to protective mechanisms and manual monitoring.
